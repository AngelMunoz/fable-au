# Aurelia 2 + F# and Fable Compiler

This is just a small PoC sample that blends together aurelia + F# given how flexible and configurable is aurelia 2 we can now start exploring whether it makes sense to port or have Aurelia applications within the F# ecosystem.

Aurelia uses classes and decoragors for almost everything but there are ways to do it without using decorators at all, this might be the way we've been looking to move aurelia into the F# ecosystem.

# Current state

This is still a playground/exploration area, don't expect anything yet
